# Tic Tac Toe
My ninth project as part of 'The Odin Project' curriculum. Here is the live preview: https://golannnnn.github.io/tic-tac-toe/

Through this project I learned how to incorporate factory functions and IIFE's in my code and I got a better understanding of how scope and closure works in JavaScript.
